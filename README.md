### Stroke Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of strokes based on various health parameters. It encompasses data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, modeling, and dealing with imbalanced data.

### Overview
- The project starts with importing necessary libraries and loading the stroke dataset.
- Data is observed, null values are checked, duplicates are removed, and a general overview of the dataset is provided.
- Preprocessing involves data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and examining correlations.
- Visualization is carried out to understand the data through EDA, histograms, box plots, and pie charts.
- Parameters tuning is performed for various machine learning models.
- Modeling is executed using a Random Forest Classifier after parameter tuning.
- Evaluation metrics such as Confusion Matrix and Classification Report are generated.
- The issue of imbalanced data is addressed using Oversampling techniques.
